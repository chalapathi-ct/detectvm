## ‚ú® Overview ‚ú®
- Can detect VMware (If VMware tools are installed)
- Can detect Oracle VirtualBox
- Can self delete if a vm is detected
- Header file is included with all the functions in a namespace DetectVM

Checks for the psuedo device ``\\.\VBoxMiniRdrDN`` which exists in virtualbox vms.  
Checks for the vmware tools registry ``SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\VMware Tool`` .  
Self Delete function spawns a hidden cmd shell which gets the file path and deletes it.  

## Prerequisites

Uses standard libraries  
Can be built using g++ (Sometimes cannot run on VMs using gcc unsure why)
```
g++ antivm.cpp -o antivm.exe -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++  -static -lpthread
```
